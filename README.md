# The-Mecanism-Used-For-Steering-
For the steering system we have used the ackerman's steering system we chose this because this system had satisfied all our expectations and would work best for our robot. We had researched immensely to find the steering system that would be best for ou robot. We had tested multiple steering systems like rack and pinion steering, electronic rear motor steering, 4 wheel steering and hydraulic steering. But all of these mechanisms had many setbacks that would slow down our robot. The perfect mechanism was servo based ackerman's steering. It had great speed and accurate turning even on sharp turn's.

# The-Motor- 
  For the motor we have used a single 12 V motor and used a gear box for the mechanism
